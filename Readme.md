My Project 5 is World's Attractions Map. 
I decided to make the whole world my neighborhood for this project to show all the atttractions I dream to visit one day. 


The live version of the map is here: http://victoria-dev.github.io/Udacity-Project-5/


The map application has a map with markers for all the attractions, the listview and the search bar. 


Users can click on any marker and see the infowindow with Google Place image of the attraction, attraction title and geography and links to infrmartion about the tourist's attraction from the wikitravel.org and also check out the best hotels nearby from yelp. 


Users can also click on any location from the listview and the infowindow with it's information will open.


In the listview there are also two buttons for each attraction. Clicking "More info" button will show the wikipedia data about the chosen location and the list of articles from wikipedia about it.


Clicking the Photos button will show the photos (search results for the chosen attraction from Flicr).


The Search bar allows users to search for the attraction either by its name or city.
